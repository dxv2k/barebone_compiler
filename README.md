LANGUAGUE: Python

CORE FUNCTION:
    Basic compiler going to contains: 
    - Tokenizer 
    - Parser 
    - Abstract syntax tree (AST) 
    - Code generation 
    - Optimization (if possible)

    Now, you'll have to think about these things: 
    - Token class
        + Data type: array (?)

    - AST class
        + Data type: Python dictionary (?)
        + 
    - Tree traversal algorithm (Depth-first)
    - Transform token into AST
    - Code generation from AST

ADDITIONAL: 
    - Text editor 
    - Syntax highlight
    - Support compile inside text editor (Simple IDE)
        + Implement VIM as text editor 



FEATURE: 
    - THINKING ABOUT WRITING FUNCTION (SUBPROGRAM) 
        + CONCERT about function name (SUBPROGRAM NAME)
    - ERROR, WARNING 
    - Support comment
    - LOCAL and GLOBAL VARIABLES 
    - PASSING: 
        + Pass-by-value 
        + pass-by-result
        + pass-by-reference
        + pass-by-value-result
CONCERN: 
    - RULES FOR FUNCTION NAMES AND VARIABLES NAME
    - Limit input, object passing and memory CONCERN
