LEXICAL ANAYLZER (~ SYNTAX ANAYLZER)

Thinking of implement YACC 
Basically, YACC is a set of regular expressions which
process stream of input and paritioning it into token 
That tokens receive from YACC could be use to build 
abstract syntax tree (AST) and then could be transform
into any higher languagues or excetuable program 

Lexical analyzer can also be used as parser generator 
to perform the lexical analysis phase  


LEX SOURCE
    {definition} 
    %% 
    {rules} 
    %% 
    {user subroutines}
    this part and how to impelement regular expression in this 
    Should you write your own lexical anaylyzer?
