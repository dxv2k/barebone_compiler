This file will describe name rules when using compilers (identifier)

RESERVED WORD LIST: 
    clear
    copy 
    decr 
    incr 
    init 
    do 
    while  
    - Reserved words are case insensitive  

COMMENTS: 
    comments start with '#' until end of line  

IDENTIFIER/VARIABLE NAME: 
    MUST BEGIN WITH ALPHABET NAMES 
    UPPERCASE AND LOWERCASE ARE THE SAME 
        - Ex: Foo, FoO, FOO are the same

STATEMENTS: 
    incr <variable_name>;                       # increase variable by 1 
    decr <variable_name>;                       # decrease variable by 1 
    clear <variable_name>;                      # make variable to zero   
    init <variable_name> <value>                # variable_name = value  

    while <variable_name> not 0 do              # loop while variable_name not 0 
        <STATEMENTS>                            # may contain one or more statements in while loop 
    end; 

    copy <variable_name1> to <variable_name2>   # copy variable_name1 to variable_name2
        
I/O:         
    <NO IDEA>    
        
LANGUAGE STRUCTURE: 
     VARIABLE MUST BE DECLARE BEFORE USING IT (?)
